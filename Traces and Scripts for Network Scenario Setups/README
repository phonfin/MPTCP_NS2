# MPTCP_NS2
This folder contents the traces and scripts for the NS2 simulations.

With these scripts, the following experiments can be conducted.

1. Simulation under fat-tree topology with different network scales (i.e., different number of pods);
2. Simulation under leaf-spine topology with different network scales (i.e., different number of racks)
3. Simulation under four typical data center applications;
4. Simulation under four different network scenarios (i.e., asymetric network, impact of in-network/end-host buffer size).

NOTE: ensure that the parameters of the scripts are correctly input when running the scripts.
